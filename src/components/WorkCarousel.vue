    Mega Cat Studios
    Junior Game Developer
    July 2022 - October 2022
    I worked at Mega Cat, a Pennsylvania, USA-based game studio, for my undergraduate internship focusing on the technical aspects of game development. During my internship, I was exposed to different teams working on a mid-tier game, which provided me with the invaluable experience of being part of a project with significantly larger scope than a start-up or academic project. I went through Quality Assurance to learn bug testing and documentation, Technical Art to learn how to make and use shaders, and Test Engineering to automate testing and data collection.

    Blue Entity Technologies
    Web Developer
    September 2021 - January 2022
    I worked at Blue Entity technologies when they were an early-stage startup, with my main responsibilities being front-end development and maintaining the Content Management System.
    I translated wireframes and Adobe XD concepts into functional and responsive websites, with consideration for Search Engine Optimization and integration with a CMS. I mainly developed marketing websites for international clients, using techniques like animations and horizontal scrolling for a better and more memorable user experience for their customers
    Here is a sample project I worked on as the lead developer https://www.thepathway.com/ , and a larger project where I was a team member https://www.englishoms.com/
